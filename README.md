## Introduction
ProfessorAI is designed to tackle the challenges faced by students and professors in today's digital learning environment. Our platform addresses student procrastination and the difficulties professors encounter in delivering comprehensive course materials within limited class hours. By developing a user-friendly platform equipped with a chatbot for easy access to a variety of educational resources, including video presentations and PDFs, ProfessorAI aims to encourage consistent student engagement throughout the semester and enhance the educational journey. Leveraging advanced AI technology and large language models, ProfessorAI seeks to revolutionize the learning experience, making it more seamless and effective for both students and professors.

## Problem Statement
Professors face the challenge of effectively delivering a comprehensive curriculum within a limited time, compounded by students' frequent concentration lapses. There is a crucial need for a platform that allows professors to archive their course materials, including lecture videos, in a format that enables students to engage with the content through interactive, conversational experiences.

## Solution Proposed
The proposed solution involves leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) through the ProfessorAI platform to enhance educational experiences. This method allows professors to upload their course content onto the platform. The LLM then processes, learns, and organizes this data efficiently. Students benefit by engaging with a chat application that gives them access to any information related to their coursework. This system is not limited to mere summarization; it also encourages deeper exploration of subjects, aided by additional resources like books recommended by professors. This approach fundamentally transforms and enriches the student learning journey by providing a more dynamic, interactive, and comprehensive educational tool.
