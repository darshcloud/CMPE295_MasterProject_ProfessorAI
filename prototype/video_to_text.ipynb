correctly determine labels for new data this technique is used for example in speech recognition or by YouTube to recommend you video unsupervised learning is used when we have unlabeled data the most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis it's able to find hidden similarities patterns or groups unsupervised learning methods are used for example in bioinformatics for genetic

going to start talking about this course content now what is this course about it's about algorithms right. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk7.wav : Directions to algorithms really what the course is about is teaching you to solve computational problems but it's more than that it's not just about teaching you to solve. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk8.wav : Go one salve.

and you'll find that over the course of this class you'll be doing a lot more writing than you do in a lot of your other courses it really should. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk15.wav : Kbb ci kind of class because you'll be doing a lot more writing than you will be coding for sure so it's really of course solving the the comput. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk16.wav : No problem is important but really the thing that you're getting out of this class and other theory classes that you're not getting in other classes in this. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk17.wav : Department is that we really concentrate on being able to prove that the things you're doing are correct and better than other things and being able to communicate those ideas to others. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk18.wav : And not just to a computer right to other people convince them that it's correct okay so that's what this class is about so what. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk19.wav : What do i mean when i say solve a computational problem what is a problem what is an algorithm right i know people make fun of. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk20.wav : Anyone want to answer that question no what's the problem. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk21.wav : Computationally no okay so it's not such a stupid question yeah something you want to compute okay. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk22.wav : Yes that's that's true right but kind of a little bit more abstractly what i'm going to think of a computational problem being and this is where. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk23.wav : You're kind of your prerequisite and discrete mathematics should come in right it's a problem is kind of you've got a set of inputs. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk24.wav : Inputs okay maybe i have one two three four five possible input so i could have to my algorithm okay. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk25.wav : Then i have a space of outputs okay outputs and maybe i don't know maybe i have more of them than i do in. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk26.wav : But these are the possible outputs to my my problem and what a problem is is a binary relation between these inputs and outputs. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk27.wav : It's essentially for each input i specify which of these outputs is correct right it doesn't necessarily have to be one right if i.

Goes to one to i don't know there's a there's some kind of mapping here these edges represent the binary relationship and it's kind of a graph. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk31.wav : Play part-time grass between these inputs and outputs and these are specifying which of these outputs are correct for these inputs all right that's really the formal. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk32.wav : Definition of what a problem is now generally if i have a problem and a computational problem i'm not going to specify the problem. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk33.wav : To you by saying okay for input one the correct answer is 0 and 2 the correct answer is 3 and so on and so forth that would take forever right. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk34.wav : Usually what we do when defining a problem is specify some kind of predicate saying that oh we can check if i give you an in. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk35.wav : And output i can check whether that output is correct or not that's usually how we define a problem is if i am checking for. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk36.wav : You're this index contains a 5 i can just go to that array look at index 5 and say that the index you gave me and see if it equals 5 right so usually. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk37.wav : Play weird putting it in terms of predicates because in general we don't really want to talk about small instances of problems so let's say i had the problem. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk38.wav : Among the students in this classroom do any pair of you have the same birthday okay all right well probably if there's more. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk39.wav : Put on 365 of you the answer is yes right right that by what pigeonhole principle write two of you must have the same birthday right but.

\n","Error: \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk42.wav : Two of you would be born in the same year on the same day in the same our right that would be a little less likely in fact as long as that space is

you that that's a kind of the a birthday problem you may have seen in 042. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk45.wav : But in general i don't i don't i'm not going to mess with probability so much here i want to deterministic algorithm right away of checking. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk46.wav : Whether to if you have the same birth time let's say okay so in general in this class we're not going to concentrate on input such as. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk47.wav : Is there a prairie view in this class that have the same birthday that's kind of boring right i could just say well. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk48.wav : I could do a lot of different things but what we we do in this class is for a fixed classroom of you i want to make. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk49.wav : An algorithm that not only applies to this classroom. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk50.wav : But also the machine learning class before you write i want an algorithm that can change its it can accept an arbit. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk51.wav : Carly sized input right here we have a class of maybe $300,400 students right but i want my algorithm to work for a billion students right like maybe.

\n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk55.wav : I want a kind of a fixed size algorithm to solve those problems okay so what is an algorithm then. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk56.wav : I really. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk57.wav : I didn't lie to you so an algorithm is a little different than a problem a problem specific. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk58.wav : Then i can stay to you what this graph or i can tell you what this graph looks like an algorithm is really i don't know what the outputs are i don't know what these edges are. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk59.wav : But what i want to i want to fix size kind of machine or procedure that if i give it an input it will generate an output. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk60.wav : And if it generates an output it better be one of

outputs but if it output. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk62.wav : This guy for this input that would not be a correct algorithm right and so generally what we want is a an algorithm is a function it takes input. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk63.wav : An algorithm is some kind of function right that takes these inputs maps it to a single output and that output better.

and then as i keep interviewing you i'm going to find out your birthday i'm going to check the record i'm going to look through all the birthdays in the record if. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk71.wav : I don't and i don't find. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk72.wav : How much i just stick you at the end of the record i add you to the record and then i move on to the next person i keep doing this

algorithm have to be a pure function in ma. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk85.wav : As in it needs to map to a single output. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk86.wav : So we're talking about kind of a

various combinations of either their none of them have the same birthday. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk97.wav : Some two of them have the same birthday i could try all possibilities and i could go through lots of different possibilities i need to check that this algorithm returns the right answer in all such cases. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk98.wav : I don't know 300 of you that's going to be a little bit more difficult to argue and so if i want to argue something is correct in mathematics i want. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk99.wav : What kind of technique do i use to prove such things induction right and in general what. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk100.wav : What are we doing this class what we do is as a computer scientist as we write a constant sized piece of code right. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk101.wav : Take on any arbitrarily large size input right if it's if the input can be arbitrarily large but our code is small. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk102.wav : Can that code needs to loop or a curse or repeat some of these lines of code in order to just read that output right and so. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk103.wav : That's another way you can arrive at this conclusion that we're going to probably need to use recursion induction and that's part of the reason why we asked you to take a. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk104.wav : On proofs and and inductive reasoning and discrete mathematics before this class okay so how do we prove that this thing is correct. \n","Error: \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk106.wav : What is induction so how can we set up this induction what do i need for an inductive. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk107.wav : Sure bass case we need a bass case we need some kind of. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk108.wav : A predicate yeah but we need some kind of statement of a hypothesis of something that should be maintained right and then we need to have an inductive step which basically says i take. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk109.wav : A small value of this thing i use the inductive hypothesis and i argue it for a larger value of my well-ordered set that i'm inducting. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk110.wav : Okay so in for this algorithm if we're going to try to prove correctness what i'm going to do is i'm going to what do i. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk111.wav : Proof of this thing that at the end of interviewing all of you that my algorithm has either already it has returned with a pair that match. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk112.wav : Or if we're in a case where there wasn't a matt it wasn't a pair somewhere in my set that it would turn on right that would be correct. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk113.wav : What i'm going to do is i'm going to say. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk114.wav : Let's say after i've interviewed the first case students right if there was a match in those first case. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk115.wav : I want to be sure that i've ever returned to pair right because if after i interview all of you i've maintained that. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk116.wav : I will have returned a pair of one exists so here's going to be my inductive hypothesis. \n","Error: \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk118.wav : First k students contain. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk119.wav : A match algorithm returns. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk120.wav : Before interviewing. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk121.wav : Say student k plus one okay so that's going to be my inductive hypothesis. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk122.wav : Now if there's any students in this class right and at the end of my thing i'm trying to interview student and plus one. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk123.wav : What's 9 + 1 is not there if i have maintained this then if i replace k within then i will have returned to match. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk124.wav : Before interviewing the last student or the when i have no more students left and then this algorithm returns none as it should write. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk125.wav : Okay so this inductive hypothesis sets up a nice variable to induct on right this k i can have increasing. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk126.wav : Up to end starting at some base case so what's my base case here. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk127.wav : My base case is the easiest thing i can do to that's an easy thing i could do i could check those. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk128.wav : Zero right after interviewing zero. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk129.wav : I haven't done any work right certainly the first zero can't have a match right and so this pre. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk130.wav : What's this inductive hypothesis is true just because this initial predicate is false right so i can. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk131.wav : Play you know this case zero check definitely this predicate holds for that okay now we got to go. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk132.wav : Go for the the meat of this thing right assume the inductive. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk133.wav : What is this true for k equals say some k prime okay and we're considering k. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk134.wav : Tell us one right then we have two cases one of the nice things about induction is that it. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk135.wav : Isolates are are problem to not consider everything all at once but break it down into a smaller interface so i can do less work. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk136.wav : Each step right so there are two cases either the first k. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk137.wav : Already had a match right in which case by our inductive hypothesis we've already returned to correct answer right. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk138.wav : What other case is the it doesn't have a match and we interview the k plus one student the cape prime plus one. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk139.wav : If there is a match in the first prime plus one students then it will include k plus k. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk140.wav : Just won the student cape prime plus one because you know otherwise there would have been a matching in the things before it right so there are two cases if. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk141.wav : Play contains match okay prime the first k contains match. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk142.wav : Already returned turn turn turn turn turn turn it by. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk143.wav : Induction right else if. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk144.wav : What's 9 + 1 students contains match the algorithm checks all of the possibilities. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk145.wav : Against against all students. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk146.wav : Essentially by brute force it's a case analysis i check all of the possible possibilities write this check if birthday is in record i haven't told you. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk147.wav : How to do that yet but if i'm able to do that i'm going to check if it's in the record if it's in the record then there will be a match and i can return it. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk148.wav : Otherwise i have re-established the inductive high policy hypothesis for. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk149.wav : Okay so. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk150.wav : That's how we prove correctness this is a little bit more formal than we would ask you to do in this class all the time but it's definitely sufficient. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk151.wav : You know for the levels of arguments that we will ask you to do the bar that we're usually trying to set is if you communicated to someone else. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk152.wav : Making this class what your algorithm was they would be able to code it up and tell a stupid computer how to do that thing okay. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk153.wav : Stop any any questions on induction you're going to be using it throughout this class and so if. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk154.wav : Unfamiliar with this line of argument then you should go review some of that that would be good okay so that's correctness being able to. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk155.wav : Repeat that the problem the algorithm we stated was correct now we want to argue that it's sufficient right what is efficiency mean. \n","Error: \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk157.wav : Easy just means not only how fast does this algorithm run but how fast does it compare to other possible ways. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk158.wav : So how can we measure how fast an algorithm runs this is. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk159.wav : Kind of a silly question yeah yeah just i mean just record the time it takes for a computer to do this thing right now there's a problem. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk160.wav : Home with just coding up an algorithm telling a computer what to do and timing how long it takes why yeah. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk161.wav : It would depend on the size of your data set okay we expect that but there's a bigger problem there yeah. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk162.wav : It depends on the strength of your computer right so i would expect that you know if i had a watch calculator and i programmed it to do something. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk163.wav : Right that might take a lot longer to solve a problem then if i asked you know ibm's research. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk164.wav : Computer right to solve the same problem using the same algorithm even with the same code right because its underlying operations. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk165.wav : Are much faster right how it runs as much faster so i don't want to count how long it would take on a real machine i kind of want to abstract the. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk166.wav : Time it takes the machines to do stuff out of the picture but i kind of want to say is let's assume that each kind of fundamental operation that the computer can do. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk167.wav : Who fixed amount of time okay how many of those kinds of fixed operations does the algorithm need to perform to be able to solve this problem. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk168.wav : Alright so here we don't don't measure time. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk169.wav : Instead counts kind of fundamental operations. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk170.wav : Okay we'll get to what some of those fundamental operations are in a second but the idea is we want to measure of how. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk171.wav : Algorithm performs not necessarily an implementation of that algorithm right kind of an abstract notion of how well this algorithm does and. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk172.wav : So what we're going to use to measure time or efficiency right it's something called asymptotic analysis. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk173.wav : Anyone here understand what asymptotic analysis is probably since it's in both of your prerequisites i think but we will go through. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk174.wav : Do a formal definition of asymptotic notation in recitation tomorrow and you'll get a lot of practice in comparing functions using. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk175.wav : An asymptotic analysis but just to give you an idea right the idea here is we don't measure timely instead measure. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk176.wav : And like your colleague over here was saying before we expect performance. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk177.wav : I'm going to use performance instead of time here we expect that to depend on. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk178.wav : Size of our input right if we're trying to run an algorithm to find a birthday. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk179.wav : In this section we expect the algorithm to run in a shorter amount of time than if i were to run the algorithm on all of you right. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk180.wav : So we expected to perform differently depending on the size of the input and how differently is how we measure performance. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk181.wav : As a variable for what the size of our input is right but that's not always the case so for example if we have a. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk182.wav : An array that i give you an n by n ray right that we're going to say and but what's the size of our input how much information. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk183.wav : What station do i need to convey to you to give you that information right so that's the size of our input in that that context right or if i give you a graph it's usually. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk184.wav : Number of vertices plus the number of edges that's how big it how much space i would need to convey to you that graph that information okay so. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk185.wav : We compare how fast an algorithm is with respect to the size of the input right and if that. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk186.wav : Will use the asymptotic notation we have big o notation which corresponds to upper bounds. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk187.wav : Will have omega which corresponds to lower bounds. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk188.wav : And we have theta which corresponds to both right this thing is tight it. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk189.wav : Is bounded from above and below by a function of this form okay. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk190.wav : A couple of common functions that algorithms they're running. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk191.wav : Time we have a couple common functions that relate an algorithms input size to its performance. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk192.wav : Can anyone give me some of those say again sorry so like. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk193.wav : Function i'm not asking this question well but has anyone heard of a linear algorithm. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk194.wav : Performance of my algorithm is linear with respect to the size of my input. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk195.wav : Say again like putting something in a list okay so that's there's. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk196.wav : But that's an example of if i do it in a silly way i stick something in the middle of a list and. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk197.wav : We have to move everything that's an operation that could take linear time right okay so linear time is is a type of function we've got a number of these. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk198.wav : I'm going to start with this one is anyone know what this one is constant time okay basically no matter how i change the input. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk199.wav : The amount of time this running time the performance of my algorithm takes it doesn't really depend on that okay the next one up is. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk200.wav : Something like this this is logarithmic time okay we have data and which is. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk201.wav : Linear and login right sometimes we call this log linear but we usually just say and login. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk202.wav : Okay you have a quadratic running time in general if i have a constant power up here right. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk203.wav : End to the sea for some constant this is what we call polynomial time as long as she is some constant and this. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk204.wav : Right here is what we mean by efficient in this class usually right into other classes right when you have big data sets maybe this is efficient right but. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk205.wav : In this class generally what we mean is polynomial and as you get down this thing these are things are more and more efficient okay. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk206.wav : There's one class i'm going to talk to you about over here which is something like let's do this two to the theta. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk207.wav : Then write exponential time this is some constant to a function of n that say super linear. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk208.wav : That's going to be you know pretty bad why is it pretty bad if i were to plot some of these things. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk209.wav : As a function of an right let's say i plot values of up to 1000 on on my n scale here. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk210.wav : What is constant look like maybe this is a thousand up here too what is a constant look like looks like a line. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk211.wav : Right it looks like a line over here somewhere it could be as high as i want but eventually anything that's an increase in function will get bigger than this right. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk212.wav : And on this scale if i use log base 2 or some reasonable small constant what is log look like. \n","Error: \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk214.wav : That's the kind of bass that we are comparing everything against what is log look like this okay but on at this scale. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk215.wav : Right at this scale really it's much closer to constant than linear and actually as. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk216.wav : That's much much larger it's almost looks like a straight line it almost looks like a constant so long is almost just as good as constant right. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk217.wav : What is exponential look like it's the exact inverse of this thing right right it's almost an exact. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk218.wav : I'm going up right so this is crap this is really good almost anything in this region over here is better. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk219.wav : At least i'm gaining something i'm not i'm able to not go up too high. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk220.wav : Relative to my input size so quadratic i don't know something like this and then login is something like this and login after a long time really starts just looking linear with. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk221.wav : A constant multiplied in front of it right okay so these things good that thing bad okay that's good that's trying. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk222.wav : All right so how do we measure these things if if i don't know what my fundamental operations are that my computer can. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk223.wav : Can can use right so we need to define some kind of model of computation. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk224.wav : For what are computers allowed to do in constant time in a fixed amount of time right. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk225.wav : In general what we use in this class is a machine called a word ram which we you know use for it's theoretical brevity. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk226.wav : Word ram it's kind of a loaded term what do these things mean it means i have. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk227.wav : Random access memory right it means that i can randomly access. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk228.wav : Different places in memory in constant time that's that's the assumption of random access memory basically what are model of a computer is. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk229.wav : You have memory memory which is essentially just a string of it it's just a bunch of ones and zeros right. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk230.wav : And we have a computer like a cpu right which is really small it can basically hold a small amount of information but. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk231.wav : Can change that information write it can operate on that information and it also has instructions to randomly access different places in memory bring it into the cpu act. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk232.wav : Read it back that makes sense but in general we don't have an address for every bit in memory every. \n","Error: \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk234.wav : Okay so so we're going to get there actually what a modern computer is. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk235.wav : When is bites okay collections of 8 bits so there's an address i have for every 8-bits in memory consecutive 8 bits and memory and so if i want to. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk236.wav : Something into the cpu i give it an address it'll take some chunk right and bring into the the cpu operated on it and spit it back okay. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk237.wav : How big is that chunk this goes to the the answer to that you were asking which is. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk238.wav : It's some sequence of some fixed number of bits which we call a word okay a word is how how big of a chunk that the. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk239.wav : Is there a cpu can take in from memory at a time and operate on okay in your computers how big is that word size 64 bits. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk240.wav : Alright that's how much i can operate on a time when i was growing up when i was your age okay my word size with 32 bits. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk241.wav : What actually was a problem for my computer because in order for me to be able to read to address. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk242.wav : I need to be able to store that address in my cpu in a word right but if i have. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk243.wav : Two bits how many different addresses can i address i have a limitation on the memory addresses i can address right so how many different. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk244.wav : Two to the 32 right that makes sense well if you do that calculation out how big. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk245.wav : Hard disk can i have to assess it's about 4 gigabytes right so when i in my day all hard drives were limited to. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk246.wav : No being partition even if you had a bigger than 4 gigabyte hard drive i had to partition it into these 4 gb chunks which you know the the computer could then. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk247.wav : That's a restriction with. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk248.wav : Four bits what's my limitation on memory that i can address by addressable turns out to be something like. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk249.wav : The 20 exabytes to put this in contacts to all data that google stores on their servers on all drives. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk250.wav : About the world is about 10 right so we're not going to run out of this limitation very soon right so what do we got we got. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk251.wav : Cpu it can address memory what are the operations i can do in this cpu generally i have binary operations. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk252.wav : I can compare two words in memory and i can either do you know integer arithmetic. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk253.wav : Kind of logical operations bitwise oper. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk254.wav : We're not going to use those so much in this class and i can read and write from the an address in memory a word. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk255.wav : In constant time those are the operations that i have available to me on most cpus some cpus give you a little bit more power but this is generally. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk256.wav : Play what we analyze algorithms with respect to okay but you'll notice that my cpu is only built to operate. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk257.wav : On a constant amount of information at once generally two words in memory an operation produces a third one and i spit it out right. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk258.wav : It takes a constant amount of time to operate on a constant amount of memory if i want to operate on a linear amount of memory and. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk259.wav : How long is that going to take i just want to read everything in that thing it's going to take me linear time right because i have to read every. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk260.wav : What we're going to do for the first half of this class mostly first eight lectures anyway. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk261.wav : Let's talk about data structures and it's going to be concerned about. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk262.wav : That's not operating on constant amount of data at a time like our cpu is doing but instead what it's going to do is operate on. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk263.wav : Store a large amount of data and support different operations on that data okay so if i had a record that i want to maintain the store those birthdays that we had. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk264.wav : I might use something like a static array right which you guys maybe are not familiar with if. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk265.wav : You have been working in python is your only programming language okay python has a lot of really interesting data structures like a list and a set and a dictionary and all these kinds of things. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk266.wav : Things that are actually not in this model there's actually a lot of code between you and the computer and it's not always clear how. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk267.wav : What's time that interface is taking right and so we're going to do starting on thursday is talk about waze.

the class we're going to spend quiz 1 the first to eight lectures on data structures. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk273.wav : And sorting second quiz will be on shortest path algorithms and graphs and then the last one will be on dynamic programming okay that's the. \n","audio-fixed-chunks/chunk274.wav : The first lecture thanks for coming. \n","\n","Full text: Good morning everybody my name is jason cool i'm going to be teaching. This class in introduction to algorithms with two other instructors here faculty in the department eric domain and justin solomon. They're excellent people and so they will be working on teaching this class with me i will be. Teaching the first lecture and we'll have each of them teach one of the next two lectures and then we'll go from there yeah so. That's this is intro to algorithms okay so we're going to start talking about this course content now what is this course about it's about algorithms right. Directions to algorithms really what the course is about is teaching you to solve computational problems but it's more than that it's not just about teaching you to solve. Go one salve. Computational problems but it's more than that it's also about communicating. Those solutions to others and being able to communicate that your way of solving the problem is correct and efficient okay. So it's about two more things prove correct. Darkness argue efficiency and. It's about communication communication i can't spell by the way. Communication of these ideas and you'll find that over the course of this class you'll be doing a lot more writing than you do in a lot of your other courses it really should. Kbb ci kind of class because you'll be doing a lot more writing than you will be coding for sure so it's really of course solving the the comput. No problem is important but really the thing that you're getting out of this class and other theory classes that you're not getting in other classes in this. Department is that we really concentrate on being able to prove that the things you're doing are correct and better than other things and being able to communicate those ideas to others. And not just to a computer right to other people convince them that it's correct okay so that's what this class is about so what. What do i mean when i say solve a computational problem what is a problem what is an algorithm right i know people make fun of. Anyone want to answer that question no what's the problem. Computationally no okay so it's not such a stupid question yeah something you want to compute okay. Yes that's that's true right but kind of a little bit more abstractly what i'm going to think of a computational problem being and this is where. You're kind of your prerequisite and discrete mathematics should come in right it's a problem is kind of you've got a set of inputs. Inputs okay maybe i have one two three four five possible input so i could have to my algorithm okay. Then i have a space of outputs okay outputs and maybe i don't know maybe i have more of them than i do in. But these are the possible outputs to my my problem and what a problem is is a binary relation between these inputs and outputs. It's essentially for each input i specify which of these outputs is correct right it doesn't necessarily have to be one right if i. Play give me the index in an array containing the value 5 there could be multiple fives in that array and so any of those indices would be. Correct so maybe this guy maps to that output and maybe this guy maps to i don't know two or three outputs right this input. Goes to one to i don't know there's a there's some kind of mapping here these edges represent the binary relationship and it's kind of a graph. Play part-time grass between these inputs and outputs and these are specifying which of these outputs are correct for these inputs all right that's really the formal. Definition of what a problem is now generally if i have a problem and a computational problem i'm not going to specify the problem. To you by saying okay for input one the correct answer is 0 and 2 the correct answer is 3 and so on and so forth that would take forever right. Usually what we do when defining a problem is specify some kind of predicate saying that oh we can check if i give you an in. And output i can check whether that output is correct or not that's usually how we define a problem is if i am checking for. You're this index contains a 5 i can just go to that array look at index 5 and say that the index you gave me and see if it equals 5 right so usually. Play weird putting it in terms of predicates because in general we don't really want to talk about small instances of problems so let's say i had the problem. Among the students in this classroom do any pair of you have the same birthday okay all right well probably if there's more. Put on 365 of you the answer is yes right right that by what pigeonhole principle write two of you must have the same birthday right but. So let's let's generalize it a little bit say that i don't know i need a bigger space of birthdays for this question to be interesting maybe i attack on. Two of you would be born in the same year on the same day in the same our right that would be a little less likely in fact as long as that space is larger than something like. The square of the number of you right then i'm less likely than than even to. You have a pair of you that that's a kind of the a birthday problem you may have seen in 042. But in general i don't i don't i'm not going to mess with probability so much here i want to deterministic algorithm right away of checking. Whether to if you have the same birth time let's say okay so in general in this class we're not going to concentrate on input such as. Is there a prairie view in this class that have the same birthday that's kind of boring right i could just say well. I could do a lot of different things but what we we do in this class is for a fixed classroom of you i want to make. An algorithm that not only applies to this classroom. But also the machine learning class before you write i want an algorithm that can change its it can accept an arbit. Carly sized input right here we have a class of maybe $300,400 students right but i want my algorithm to work for a billion students right like maybe. I'm trying to check if there's a match of something in the facebook database or something like that right okay so in general we are. Looking for general problems that have. Arbitrarily sized inputs right so these these inputs could grow very large but. I want a kind of a fixed size algorithm to solve those problems okay so what is an algorithm then. I really. I didn't lie to you so an algorithm is a little different than a problem a problem specific. Then i can stay to you what this graph or i can tell you what this graph looks like an algorithm is really i don't know what the outputs are i don't know what these edges are. But what i want to i want to fix size kind of machine or procedure that if i give it an input it will generate an output. And if it generates an output it better be one of these correct outputs right so if i have an algorithm that takes in this input i really want it to. Similarly for this one it could output any of these three outputs but if it output. This guy for this input that would not be a correct algorithm right and so generally what we want is a an algorithm is a function it takes input. An algorithm is some kind of function right that takes these inputs maps it to a single output and that output better. Correct based on our problem okay so that's what our algorithm is it solves the problem if it returns the correct output for every problem. Input that is in our domain okay and the example for does anyone have a possible algorithm for checking. Are there any two of you have the same birth time as specified before i'm going to let someone else have a try. Essentially what it's going to do is i'm going to i'm going to put you guys in some order okay i'm going to give you some of you a number one through however many. Number of students there are in this class and i'm going to interview you one by one right i'm going to say what's your birthday and then i will write it down right i'm going to put in some kind of record. Okay and then as i keep interviewing you i'm going to find out your birthday i'm going to check the record i'm going to look through all the birthdays in the record if. I don't and i don't find. How much i just stick you at the end of the record i add you to the record and then i move on to the next person i keep doing this okay so that's that's a proposed algorithm for this birthday problem. For birthday problem what's the algorithm. Maintain a record. Interview students students in some order. And what is interviewing a student mean it means two things it means check. If birthday in record and if it is. I'm going to turn a pair so return pair otherwise. Add new students to record. And then at the very end if i go through everybody and i haven't found a match yet i'm going to return that there is none. Okay so that's a statement of an algorithm that's kind of the level of description that will be looking for you in the theory part of. It's a verbal description in words that you know. Maybe not enough for a computer to know what to do but if you said this algorithm to any of your friends in this class right they would at least understand. And what it is that you're doing yeah pure function in the does a an algorithm have to be a pure function in ma. As in it needs to map to a single output. So we're talking about kind of a functional programming definition of of a of a of a function. This is i am talking about the mathematical i have a binary relation and this thing has an output for every input. That's the mathematical definition of function that i'm using for when i'm defining an algorithm yeah. An algorithm is a procedure that somehow i can do. Whatever i want but i have to take one of these inputs and i have to produce an output and at the end it better be correct right so it's just a procedure you can think of it as like a. You can think of it it's just some kind of procedure right it's a sequence of things that you should do and then at the end you will return an output okay so here's. A possible algorithm for solving this birthday problem okay now i have given you what i argue to you. I'm asserting to you is a solution to this birthday problem and maybe you guys agree with me and maybe some of you don't write so how do i. I miss you that this is correct alright well if i had you know if i was just running this algorithm. On say the four students in the front row here right i could argue it pretty well to you i could go through every. Let you know i could have signed these for people birthdays in various combinations of either their none of them have the same birthday. Some two of them have the same birthday i could try all possibilities and i could go through lots of different possibilities i need to check that this algorithm returns the right answer in all such cases. I don't know 300 of you that's going to be a little bit more difficult to argue and so if i want to argue something is correct in mathematics i want. What kind of technique do i use to prove such things induction right and in general what. What are we doing this class what we do is as a computer scientist as we write a constant sized piece of code right. Take on any arbitrarily large size input right if it's if the input can be arbitrarily large but our code is small. Can that code needs to loop or a curse or repeat some of these lines of code in order to just read that output right and so. That's another way you can arrive at this conclusion that we're going to probably need to use recursion induction and that's part of the reason why we asked you to take a. On proofs and and inductive reasoning and discrete mathematics before this class okay so how do we prove that this thing is correct. What is induction so how can we set up this induction what do i need for an inductive. Sure bass case we need a bass case we need some kind of. A predicate yeah but we need some kind of statement of a hypothesis of something that should be maintained right and then we need to have an inductive step which basically says i take. A small value of this thing i use the inductive hypothesis and i argue it for a larger value of my well-ordered set that i'm inducting. Okay so in for this algorithm if we're going to try to prove correctness what i'm going to do is i'm going to what do i. Proof of this thing that at the end of interviewing all of you that my algorithm has either already it has returned with a pair that match. Or if we're in a case where there wasn't a matt it wasn't a pair somewhere in my set that it would turn on right that would be correct. What i'm going to do is i'm going to say. Let's say after i've interviewed the first case students right if there was a match in those first case. I want to be sure that i've ever returned to pair right because if after i interview all of you i've maintained that. I will have returned a pair of one exists so here's going to be my inductive hypothesis. First k students contain. A match algorithm returns. Before interviewing. Say student k plus one okay so that's going to be my inductive hypothesis. Now if there's any students in this class right and at the end of my thing i'm trying to interview student and plus one. What's 9 + 1 is not there if i have maintained this then if i replace k within then i will have returned to match. Before interviewing the last student or the when i have no more students left and then this algorithm returns none as it should write. Okay so this inductive hypothesis sets up a nice variable to induct on right this k i can have increasing. Up to end starting at some base case so what's my base case here. My base case is the easiest thing i can do to that's an easy thing i could do i could check those. Zero right after interviewing zero. I haven't done any work right certainly the first zero can't have a match right and so this pre. What's this inductive hypothesis is true just because this initial predicate is false right so i can. Play you know this case zero check definitely this predicate holds for that okay now we got to go. Go for the the meat of this thing right assume the inductive. What is this true for k equals say some k prime okay and we're considering k. Tell us one right then we have two cases one of the nice things about induction is that it. Isolates are are problem to not consider everything all at once but break it down into a smaller interface so i can do less work. Each step right so there are two cases either the first k. Already had a match right in which case by our inductive hypothesis we've already returned to correct answer right. What other case is the it doesn't have a match and we interview the k plus one student the cape prime plus one. If there is a match in the first prime plus one students then it will include k plus k. Just won the student cape prime plus one because you know otherwise there would have been a matching in the things before it right so there are two cases if. Play contains match okay prime the first k contains match. Already returned turn turn turn turn turn turn it by. Induction right else if. What's 9 + 1 students contains match the algorithm checks all of the possibilities. Against against all students. Essentially by brute force it's a case analysis i check all of the possible possibilities write this check if birthday is in record i haven't told you. How to do that yet but if i'm able to do that i'm going to check if it's in the record if it's in the record then there will be a match and i can return it. Otherwise i have re-established the inductive high policy hypothesis for. Okay so. That's how we prove correctness this is a little bit more formal than we would ask you to do in this class all the time but it's definitely sufficient. You know for the levels of arguments that we will ask you to do the bar that we're usually trying to set is if you communicated to someone else. Making this class what your algorithm was they would be able to code it up and tell a stupid computer how to do that thing okay. Stop any any questions on induction you're going to be using it throughout this class and so if. Unfamiliar with this line of argument then you should go review some of that that would be good okay so that's correctness being able to. Repeat that the problem the algorithm we stated was correct now we want to argue that it's sufficient right what is efficiency mean. Easy just means not only how fast does this algorithm run but how fast does it compare to other possible ways. So how can we measure how fast an algorithm runs this is. Kind of a silly question yeah yeah just i mean just record the time it takes for a computer to do this thing right now there's a problem. Home with just coding up an algorithm telling a computer what to do and timing how long it takes why yeah. It would depend on the size of your data set okay we expect that but there's a bigger problem there yeah. It depends on the strength of your computer right so i would expect that you know if i had a watch calculator and i programmed it to do something. Right that might take a lot longer to solve a problem then if i asked you know ibm's research. Computer right to solve the same problem using the same algorithm even with the same code right because its underlying operations. Are much faster right how it runs as much faster so i don't want to count how long it would take on a real machine i kind of want to abstract the. Time it takes the machines to do stuff out of the picture but i kind of want to say is let's assume that each kind of fundamental operation that the computer can do. Who fixed amount of time okay how many of those kinds of fixed operations does the algorithm need to perform to be able to solve this problem. Alright so here we don't don't measure time. Instead counts kind of fundamental operations. Okay we'll get to what some of those fundamental operations are in a second but the idea is we want to measure of how. Algorithm performs not necessarily an implementation of that algorithm right kind of an abstract notion of how well this algorithm does and. So what we're going to use to measure time or efficiency right it's something called asymptotic analysis. Anyone here understand what asymptotic analysis is probably since it's in both of your prerequisites i think but we will go through. Do a formal definition of asymptotic notation in recitation tomorrow and you'll get a lot of practice in comparing functions using. An asymptotic analysis but just to give you an idea right the idea here is we don't measure timely instead measure. And like your colleague over here was saying before we expect performance. I'm going to use performance instead of time here we expect that to depend on. Size of our input right if we're trying to run an algorithm to find a birthday. In this section we expect the algorithm to run in a shorter amount of time than if i were to run the algorithm on all of you right. So we expected to perform differently depending on the size of the input and how differently is how we measure performance. As a variable for what the size of our input is right but that's not always the case so for example if we have a. An array that i give you an n by n ray right that we're going to say and but what's the size of our input how much information. What station do i need to convey to you to give you that information right so that's the size of our input in that that context right or if i give you a graph it's usually. Number of vertices plus the number of edges that's how big it how much space i would need to convey to you that graph that information okay so. We compare how fast an algorithm is with respect to the size of the input right and if that. Will use the asymptotic notation we have big o notation which corresponds to upper bounds. Will have omega which corresponds to lower bounds. And we have theta which corresponds to both right this thing is tight it. Is bounded from above and below by a function of this form okay. A couple of common functions that algorithms they're running. Time we have a couple common functions that relate an algorithms input size to its performance. Can anyone give me some of those say again sorry so like. Function i'm not asking this question well but has anyone heard of a linear algorithm. Performance of my algorithm is linear with respect to the size of my input. Say again like putting something in a list okay so that's there's. But that's an example of if i do it in a silly way i stick something in the middle of a list and. We have to move everything that's an operation that could take linear time right okay so linear time is is a type of function we've got a number of these. I'm going to start with this one is anyone know what this one is constant time okay basically no matter how i change the input. The amount of time this running time the performance of my algorithm takes it doesn't really depend on that okay the next one up is. Something like this this is logarithmic time okay we have data and which is. Linear and login right sometimes we call this log linear but we usually just say and login. Okay you have a quadratic running time in general if i have a constant power up here right. End to the sea for some constant this is what we call polynomial time as long as she is some constant and this. Right here is what we mean by efficient in this class usually right into other classes right when you have big data sets maybe this is efficient right but. In this class generally what we mean is polynomial and as you get down this thing these are things are more and more efficient okay. There's one class i'm going to talk to you about over here which is something like let's do this two to the theta. Then write exponential time this is some constant to a function of n that say super linear. That's going to be you know pretty bad why is it pretty bad if i were to plot some of these things. As a function of an right let's say i plot values of up to 1000 on on my n scale here. What is constant look like maybe this is a thousand up here too what is a constant look like looks like a line. Right it looks like a line over here somewhere it could be as high as i want but eventually anything that's an increase in function will get bigger than this right. And on this scale if i use log base 2 or some reasonable small constant what is log look like. That's the kind of bass that we are comparing everything against what is log look like this okay but on at this scale. Right at this scale really it's much closer to constant than linear and actually as. That's much much larger it's almost looks like a straight line it almost looks like a constant so long is almost just as good as constant right. What is exponential look like it's the exact inverse of this thing right right it's almost an exact. I'm going up right so this is crap this is really good almost anything in this region over here is better. At least i'm gaining something i'm not i'm able to not go up too high. Relative to my input size so quadratic i don't know something like this and then login is something like this and login after a long time really starts just looking linear with. A constant multiplied in front of it right okay so these things good that thing bad okay that's good that's trying. All right so how do we measure these things if if i don't know what my fundamental operations are that my computer can. Can can use right so we need to define some kind of model of computation. For what are computers allowed to do in constant time in a fixed amount of time right. In general what we use in this class is a machine called a word ram which we you know use for it's theoretical brevity. Word ram it's kind of a loaded term what do these things mean it means i have. Random access memory right it means that i can randomly access. Different places in memory in constant time that's that's the assumption of random access memory basically what are model of a computer is. You have memory memory which is essentially just a string of it it's just a bunch of ones and zeros right. And we have a computer like a cpu right which is really small it can basically hold a small amount of information but. Can change that information write it can operate on that information and it also has instructions to randomly access different places in memory bring it into the cpu act. Read it back that makes sense but in general we don't have an address for every bit in memory every. Okay so so we're going to get there actually what a modern computer is. When is bites okay collections of 8 bits so there's an address i have for every 8-bits in memory consecutive 8 bits and memory and so if i want to. Something into the cpu i give it an address it'll take some chunk right and bring into the the cpu operated on it and spit it back okay. How big is that chunk this goes to the the answer to that you were asking which is. It's some sequence of some fixed number of bits which we call a word okay a word is how how big of a chunk that the. Is there a cpu can take in from memory at a time and operate on okay in your computers how big is that word size 64 bits. Alright that's how much i can operate on a time when i was growing up when i was your age okay my word size with 32 bits. What actually was a problem for my computer because in order for me to be able to read to address. I need to be able to store that address in my cpu in a word right but if i have. Two bits how many different addresses can i address i have a limitation on the memory addresses i can address right so how many different. Two to the 32 right that makes sense well if you do that calculation out how big. Hard disk can i have to assess it's about 4 gigabytes right so when i in my day all hard drives were limited to. No being partition even if you had a bigger than 4 gigabyte hard drive i had to partition it into these 4 gb chunks which you know the the computer could then. That's a restriction with. Four bits what's my limitation on memory that i can address by addressable turns out to be something like. The 20 exabytes to put this in contacts to all data that google stores on their servers on all drives. About the world is about 10 right so we're not going to run out of this limitation very soon right so what do we got we got. Cpu it can address memory what are the operations i can do in this cpu generally i have binary operations. I can compare two words in memory and i can either do you know integer arithmetic. Kind of logical operations bitwise oper. We're not going to use those so much in this class and i can read and write from the an address in memory a word. In constant time those are the operations that i have available to me on most cpus some cpus give you a little bit more power but this is generally. Play what we analyze algorithms with respect to okay but you'll notice that my cpu is only built to operate. On a constant amount of information at once generally two words in memory an operation produces a third one and i spit it out right. It takes a constant amount of time to operate on a constant amount of memory if i want to operate on a linear amount of memory and. How long is that going to take i just want to read everything in that thing it's going to take me linear time right because i have to read every. What we're going to do for the first half of this class mostly first eight lectures anyway. Let's talk about data structures and it's going to be concerned about. That's not operating on constant amount of data at a time like our cpu is doing but instead what it's going to do is operate on. Store a large amount of data and support different operations on that data okay so if i had a record that i want to maintain the store those birthdays that we had. I might use something like a static array right which you guys maybe are not familiar with if. You have been working in python is your only programming language okay python has a lot of really interesting data structures like a list and a set and a dictionary and all these kinds of things. Things that are actually not in this model there's actually a lot of code between you and the computer and it's not always clear how. What's time that interface is taking right and so we're going to do starting on thursday is talk about waze. Of storing a non-constant amount of information to make operations on that information faster so just before you go i just want to give you a quick. Overview of the class to solve an algorithms class in algorithm problem in this class we essentially have two different strategies. We can either reduce to using the solution to a problem we know how to solve or we can design our own algorithm which is going to be recursive in nature. A cursive algorithm we have various. Design paradigms this is all in your notes but this is essentially the structure of the class we're going to spend quiz 1 the first to eight lectures on data structures. And sorting second quiz will be on shortest path algorithms and graphs and then the last one will be on dynamic programming okay that's the. The first lecture thanks for coming. \n"]}]}]}
